# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures Coursework

## Project structure

- `data` - contains the spreadsheet with all the data on the London Underground travel times
- `src` - source file containing each task
- `src/uni` - contains the mandatory algorithms and data structures you must use for each task

## Style guides

- Use type annotations where possible to avoid ambiguity e.g. `station: str` could be a string or class a station class
- Use PEP8
- Use docstrings methods and at the top of each file (`Args: ... Returns: ...` format) not single line comments
